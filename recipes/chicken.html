    <ul>Ingredients:
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into cubes</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced cremini mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>1 cup Marsala wine </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>Steps:
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Season chicken with salt and pepper; cook in hot oil until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir onion and mushrooms with the chicken; continue cooking until the onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour cream of mushroom soup and Marsala wine over the chicken mixture; cook until hot and the chicken is no longer pink in the middle, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>    
        <p>Tip:
        Aluminum foil helps keep food moist, ensures it cooks evenly, keeps leftovers fresh, and makes clean-up easy.
